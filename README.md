if you play on a different kind of monitor (resolution), in order to make the script work, go to a practice tool game and make individual screenshots of all the champions via map.
snipping tool, make yourself the champion you wanna track in future days, screenshot only the inner part of the map icon without blue color (only if its red you can ignore it) and safe under "m"+nameOfTheChampion.
after changing the picture, make sure to start the script, write the png name and then press start.
