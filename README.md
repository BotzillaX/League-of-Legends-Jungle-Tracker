League of Legends Jungle Tracker

An Undetectable League of Legends Script

The distinguishing feature of this League of Legends script is its undetectability. This is primarily attributed to its method of operation, which involves solely examining pixels, performing basic mathematical operations, and presenting the resulting decisions on a separate display window. It is important to note that this script does not overlay or directly interact with the game interface, thereby eliminating any risk of account bans.

Instructions:

This tool serves the purpose of tracking the movements of the enemy jungler in League of Legends using a pixel bot. If your monitor resolution differs from the specified requirements, please follow these steps to set it up:

Enter a practice tool game and capture screenshots of all the champions displayed on the map.
Utilize a snipping tool to capture the specific champion you wish to track in future instances.
When capturing the champion's icon, exclude the blue color and focus solely on the inner part of the icon (disregard if the icon is red).
Save the screenshot with the prefix "m" followed by the champion's name, for instance, "mMaster.png" for Master Yi (alternatively, "mMasterYI" or any preferred naming convention).
Initiate the script and input the PNG filename of the champion you wish to track, excluding the "m" prefix (as per your chosen naming convention).
Press the "Start" button to commence the tracking process.
The script will search for the champion's icon on the map and monitor their movements.
Note: This tool is specifically designed for tracking enemy junglers in League of Legends. Its functionality relies on pixel analysis, automating the tracking process.


1. Download all the files, including the README file.
Install the files by copying the code and setting it up as I did.
Make sure to have two PNG files named "Jungle-Tracker-Picture.jpg" and "Jungle-Tracker-Picture2.jpg" in the same folder as the .py file.
After completing the installation, download the folder that contains the PNG files.
Place the downloaded folder as it is into the same folder where the .py file is located. Make sure not to change the folder or any file names.

6. keep the window on your second screen to see where the enemy jungler was last seen

7. finished. now every time the enemy jungler shows up on the map, you'll have a screen of the last seconds he was visible before disappearig.




Use Case:

In the context of strategic gameplay, the secondary screen dynamically refreshes every 2 seconds as long as the enemy jungler remains visible on the map. The underlying function of this script is to provide constant updates regarding the estimated location of the jungler. In higher-ranked matches, adeptly tracking the movements of the jungler stands as a crucial element to decisively overcome adversaries.



Note:

Updates and improvements to this script will only be provided if there is significant demand from users. Additionally, it is important to clarify that this script will always remain freely accessible and will not be subjected to any form of payment requirement.

Please be aware that using this script carries potential risks, including the possibility of account bans. As the creator of this script, I cannot accept responsibility for any negative consequences that may arise from its usage, including account suspensions or bans. It is recommended to exercise caution and adhere to the terms of service set forth by the game.
